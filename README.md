# VB-Mac

An naive web-based assembler & virtual machine of the Beta Processor architecture from [6.004 Computation Structures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/c13/c13s1/#31)

## Description

VB-Mac is a browser-based assembler & virtual machine implementation of the Beta machine architecture. I built this in 2018 while taking the Computation Structure course at Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife, as a teaching aid to help I & my colleagues practice.
I was however unable to complete the whole instruction set as a result of coursework/time.
Hope to complete or build an entirely new & better solution in the future.

My DM is open @authosoro on Twitter for collaborations, criticism or suggestions.
